Podcast, broadcast, and video transcription service for content entrepreneurs â€• Pogggo.com

INTRODUCTION
#### Have a podcast, YouTube channel, or radio show?

If so, I'm building Pogggo (it's just a logo) to help content entrepreneurs like you save countless hours not doing tedious transcriptions of high-value interviews and other audio content.

#### Why <em>this</em> service?

Audio content in the form of Podcasts and YouTube videos is a real boon for many reasons. But I selfishly chose to build this product to be exposed to more content. I'm of the opinion of learning something accidentally, <em>on purpose</em>.

Aside from the devious ulterior motive, content entrepreneurs are a very positive bunch. Many of which run one-man operations and hustle thru the tedium of manually transcribing <em>every</em> piece. Bananas.

So I hope maybe this service will help them.

Cheers,

David
